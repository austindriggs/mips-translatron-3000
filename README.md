## CONTRIBUTING

When contributing, add a comment in the form:
```c
// [WHAT] why (previous)
```

Where:
- The `[WHAT]` is what you did: CHANGE, ADD, REMOVE, or anything else. 
- The `why` is the reason for what you did. 
- The `previous` is a brief description of what was previously there just to keep a record for ourselves.
