# Delivarable Contributions

## PROMPT

Each team member must have their first and last names listed next to the part of the project that they were responsible for (this is mandatory). All team members should be fully prepared to present their work and discuss it with peers/instructor, and answer questions.


## Deliverable 1 (4%): 

A fully corrected codebase with clear comments highlighting your edits and/or new implementations. This is derived from the corrupted machine instructions that you were provided (do not be like Old Jim).

Contributers:
1. Austin Driggs
2. Nate Kirby
3. Tucker Wilson


## Deliverable 2 (4%): 

Machine code where the corrected bits are highlighted, as well as the recompiled assembly code from running the fixed machine code through your disassembler from Deliverable 1. Compile all this information and figures in a single document (follow lab report style, this document should be readable).

Contributers:

## Deliverable 3 (4%): 

Create a 3-5 min video and presentation explaining your bug fixes, documentation process, debugging process, highlighting how you identified bugs, and bit flips in the corrupted machine code demonstrating how your assembler/disassembler successfully converts the corrected instructions.
